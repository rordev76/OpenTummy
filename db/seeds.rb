# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

  "We left with lighter wallets yet unsatisfied palates, and walked next door to Epic, which offered better views, tastier food, friendlier service, less frenzy and lower prices.",
  "They charge too much. The food was good but not worth the price. Also, their wine by the glass is around $15/glass. Way too high.",
  "With the space enclosed the noise levels appear to rise and we found it verging on uncomfortable.",
  "Food was awful. Not at all Southern. Staff was accommodating and nice but the food was just starch and protein on a plate and very disappointing.",
  "Excellent view. Food was not what I expected for the price. I was not thrilled about the quality, or presentation or portion size. Too many lines. Thank goodness I had a reservation, but then had to get in line to go upstairs.",
  "Very slow service. Took 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive. Server was not attentive - all 4 of our water glasses were empty and the dessert arrived 25 minutes after placing the order. Lastly, it took 20 mins for our car to arrive from the valet.",
  "The ambiance is nice, however, the food is nothing to ride home about. It was pricey and to be honest we all walked out with room for more, yet we had no interest in ordering anything else again. The best dish was the octopus. Not impressed, would not return.",
  "Good service; food is overrated; extremely high prices - paying for the experience.",
  "I almost didn't want to write a review about this amazing restaurant because I didn't want to risk too many people hearing about this place. So I decided to give it one star instead.",
  "Wasn't much of a fan of the food. It's greasy and heavy and super spicy, and most of the flavors seem to be the same.",
  "My food tasted like it had been sitting out for half an hour. On another note, what an awesome staff manning the orders. Keep up the smiles!",
  "This was just so-so. I had high expectations for this place given its location in a foodie city, and a let down is an understatement. The food smelled great, but the taste was lacking.",
  "Highlight of the meal was a bus boy smuggling us two cheese sticks from the bar as we waited close to an hour between courses.The cheese sticks were delish.",
  "Found a fingernail in my food. The one star is for the waitress who seemed more traumatized than we were.",
  "They forgot my added avocado and charged me...unforgivable offense.",
  "Save yourself the trouble and don't go here...",
  "Food was cold and they overcharged me.. got into an argument with the manager",
  "They were out of material needed to make half the dishes on the menu.",
  "The food was alright but the ambeince was so bad. I felt uncomfortable the entire time that I couldn't even enjoy my meal.",
  "The waiter was extremely rude to my wife after he spilled on her. We immediately got up and left.",
  "The owner needs to wake up and start hiring responsible people who wants to provide good customer service. When I called 8 minutes to 3:00 the answering machine came on and said they and do not orders over the phone, so immediately called back,  someone picked up the phone and laid the receiver down but did not hang up!",
  "Nothing too special.",
  "Service: Terrible! Employees were so caught up with mingling amongst each other, not really attentive or aware of the customers.",
  "Server did not inform us of extra charges on sides so we ended up with a huge bill that we did not expect.",
  "They brought out the wrong order and the server argued with me and blamed me for ordering the wrong thing and changing my mind and forgetting.",
  "Absolutely terrible in every aspect. The worst dining experience I've ever had.",
  "Do you remember in the movie Elf with Will Ferrell in how he congratulates that diner for The World's Best Cup of Coffee when actually it was just really a really mediocre cup of coffee.",
  "Food is as expected - too much, too greasy, but exactly what we ordered.",
  "I did enjoy the food but I was so thirty for the rest of the evening and I suspect there was a lot of msg in the broth?",
  "What's going on?? I dined in last week and the taste was completely different!! Very bland and boring.",
  "Too small staff came off like it was all about the money, i need that genuine happy to have you feeling.",
  "Food was good but I didn't feel welcome at all.",
  "This place is very popular and is probably great for people in the neighborhood, but it may not be worth a trip across town with so many other options available.",
  "We had to wait 35 minutes just to get our food. But the food really was amazing.",
  "We had to wait for way too long for our food. The waitress was so ditzy and I hate to say this, she was just dumb! And so uncoordinated! She kept bumping into things.",
  "Now I don't even want to bother. I'm paranoid they'll spit in my food for complaining.",
  "Will I be back? Sure, when I get my water refilled! (I'm still waiting) - NOT!",
  "Service: Negative 5 Stars, Food: Negative 5 Stars, Value: Negative 5 Stars",
  "Just too expensive now. I ate there regularly... Sad to say I won't go back.",
  "Food is bland. Very bland, flavorless, dry (oh and it came with a free stone too on my salad!)."
